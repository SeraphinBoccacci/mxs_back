orbs:
  # The Node.js orb contains a set of prepackaged CircleCI configuration you can utilize
  # Orbs reduce the amount of configuration required for common tasks.
  # See the orb documentation here: https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/node
  node: circleci/node@4.1

jobs:
  build:
    # These next lines define a Docker executor: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/executor-types/
    # You can specify an image from Dockerhub or use one of our Convenience Images from CircleCI's Developer Hub.
    # A list of available CircleCI Docker Convenience Images are available here: https://circleci.com/developer/images/image/cimg/node
    docker:
      - image: circleci/node:12-browsers
      - image: circleci/mongo:4.4
      - image: circleci/redis:6.0.14

    # Then run your tests!
    # CircleCI will report the results back to your VCS provider.
    steps:
      # Checkout the code as the first step.
      - checkout

      # Install the latest npm - the node Orb takes care of it
      - node/install-npm

      # Next, the node orb's install-packages step will install the dependencies from a package.json.
      # The orb install-packages step will also automatically cache them for faster future runs.
      - node/install-packages

      # If you are using yarn instead npm, remove the line above and uncomment the two lines below.
      # - node/install-packages:

workflows:
  # Below is the definition of your workflow.
  # Inside the workflow, you provide the jobs you want to run, e.g this workflow runs the build-and-test job above.
  # CircleCI will run this workflow on every commit.
